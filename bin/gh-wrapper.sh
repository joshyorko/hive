# ── GENERAL COMMAND-SURFACE ALLOWLIST (#3840 F6/F7 residual; added in #3854) ─
#
# WHAT THIS GATE IS (read this before touching `_gh_surface_allowed`):
# `_gh_surface_allowed` below is a deny-by-default ALLOWLIST, not a denylist.
# A subcommand/action pair reaches real `gh` only if it is EXPLICITLY named in
# the `case` arms; anything unenumerated is rejected. Removing an arm therefore
# BLOCKS a verb, and the way to permit a new verb is to ADD an arm — never to
# "add it to a deny list". Do not restructure this into a denylist: that is the
# exact bug #3854 fixed, and audit finding L1 (2026-08-17 security review)
# flagged the stale wording here for misleading a future maintainer into
# weakening the gate.
#
# WHY (historical, pre-#3854): every gate FURTHER BELOW this block is still a
# denylist — each names a specific thing an agent must not do (`pr merge`,
# `issue create`, mutating `gh api`, ...) and the script ends in a bare
# `exec "$REAL_GH" "$@"`. Before this allowlist existed, any subcommand nobody
# thought to enumerate reached real GitHub with the App token attached. That is
# the same failure shape as the mode `case` with no default arm (fixed in
# ce9d19aa): unenumerated input takes the permissive branch.
#
# This was not theoretical. Against the stub harness, on v4 @ c9ea2cc8 (i.e.
# BEFORE the allowlist below landed in #3854), EVERY one of these reached gh
# with rc=0 — including in NO_GITHUB mode, the most restrictive mode there is,
# because the mode gates only ever inspect `subcmd = issue|pr`. All of them are
# rejected today because none is on the allowlist:
#
#   NO_GITHUB     gh auth token                 → reached gh  (exfiltrates the token)
#   NO_GITHUB     gh secret set FOO --body bar  → reached gh  (writes Actions secrets)
#   NO_GITHUB     gh ssh-key add /tmp/k.pub     → reached gh  (persistent account access)
#   NO_GITHUB     gh variable set X --body y    → reached gh
#   ISSUES_ONLY   gh repo delete owner/repo     → reached gh  (destroys the repo)
#   ISSUES_ONLY   gh release create v9.9.9      → reached gh  (publishes artifacts)
#   ISSUES_ONLY   gh gist create /etc/passwd    → reached gh  (exfiltrates file content)
#   ADVISORY      gh workflow run deploy.yml    → reached gh  (arbitrary CI execution)
#
# So we deny by default and enumerate what agents legitimately do. The permitted
# set below was derived from actual usage in this repo — the agent policies
# (src/policies/*.md, examples/kubestellar/agents/**) and bin/*.sh — NOT invented,
# so the allowlist cannot quietly break the fleet. Ordering matters: this runs
# BEFORE the mode/ACMM gates, so it only decides whether a verb is on the map at
# all. Everything it admits is still subject to every gate below — `pr merge`
# passes here and is then held by the merge-eligibility allowlist.
#
# Adding a verb here is a deliberate security decision: it must be something an
# agent genuinely needs, and it must be safe for a prompt-injected agent to run.
