//
//  1. releaseHeldTasks — clear currentTask (dropping the issue from selectTask's
//     activeIssues guard), drop any pending credential, and bump the assignment
//     generation (#2568, the Gate) so a stale worker's later completion is fenced out.
//  2. bookAndRevokeReleased — book the SAME short non-permanent failure cooldown via
//     recordTaskFailure (so the released issue is not instantly re-admissible to a
//     stale worker) and push the EXISTING task_revoke message so the relay stops
//     cleanly and re-asks for work.
//  3. RequeueContributorTask — the public entry point. It runs (1)+(2) and then
//     IMMEDIATELY reassigns each released clanker its next-priority item via selectTask
//     (the yank behaviour), self-excluding the just-released issue from that clanker so
//     it moves to different work. When nothing else is admissible the clanker is simply
//     released + idle (the old requeue-only outcome, now the fallback).
//
// None of this mints or rotates a token or changes trust. Synthetic pr-review tasks
// carry Number == 0 and are released without booking an issue-key cooldown, exactly
// like the disconnect path. A blank operator reason falls back to a default label.

// to chosen.repoFull (== repo.Full). But the task_progress RESUME path re-populates
// currentTask from the CLIENT-supplied msg.Repo after a reconnect (the relay keeps
// its task locally and re-asserts it via task_progress). If the relay reports the

// server-side "%s#%d" key built from currentTask.Repo silently MISSES:
//   - the activeIssues double-assign guard no longer excludes the in-flight issue,
//     so a concurrent selectTask hands the SAME issue to a second contributor; and

	// Honest scope note on the available signal:
	//   selectTask only iterates ActionableIssues (issues), and the per-candidate
	//   map carries `author` but NO review state. The richer signal #2390 really
	//   wants — "my PR has been reviewed / is approved / requested changes / is

	//     * bin/enumerate-actionable.sh enumerates PRs with only

	//       no "blocking"), and those PRs land in FrontendRepo.OpenPrs, which this
	//       selector does not read at all.
	//     * github.PullRequest has no review-decision field.
	//   So this change implements ONLY the ordering half of #2390, keyed on the one
	//   own-work signal that actually exists today (issue authorship). When the
	//   contributor has no own-authored candidate, we fall back to today's exact
