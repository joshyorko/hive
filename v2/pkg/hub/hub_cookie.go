// Hub session cookie integrity.
//
// The `hive_hub_user` cookie carries the logged-in GitHub username that the hub
// trusts for browser-originated API calls. Historically it stored the raw
// username, which meant anyone could hand-craft the cookie and impersonate any
// user — including the hub admin. To make the cookie tamper-evident it is now
// bound to the hub secret with an HMAC:
//
//	value = <username>.<base64url(HMAC-SHA256(username, hubSecret))>
//
// The username stays in the clear (it is not a secret and callers already know
// their own login); the appended signature is what proves the hub itself minted
// the value. Verification recomputes the HMAC and compares in constant time, so
// a forged or edited cookie fails closed.
//
// Legacy transition: existing sessions carry an UNSIGNED cookie (no "." + sig).
// Those fail verification and are treated as logged out, so the user simply
// re-authenticates through the normal login flow, which re-mints the new signed
// cookie. No stored data changes and nobody is permanently locked out.

// N2 (CWE-321/798): the session cookie is now ASYMMETRICALLY signed.
//
// The HMAC scheme below is verify-capable-implies-mint-capable, and the same key
// is provisioned into EVERY spoke so each spoke's proxy can check
// `hive_hub_user`. A spoke operator could therefore read the key out of their pod
// env and mint `clubanderson.<sig>` — a hub ADMIN cookie, accepted on ~21 admin
// routes including the cluster App-key writer. That is the whole of N2, and it is
// unfixable while the signer and the verifier hold the same bytes.
//
// The v2 format is Ed25519: the hub holds the private seed, spokes receive only
// the public key. Same split the SSO handoff already made (C2 follow-up, #2771).
//
//	v2 value = <username>.v2.<base64url(Ed25519-Sign(privateKey, username))>
//
// The ".v2." marker is what lets one verifier accept both formats during the
// rollout without ambiguity — a legacy HMAC signature can never contain a "."
// (base64url has no dot), so the two shapes are distinguishable by structure
// rather than by guessing.

// AUDIT F10 (session lifetime is neither signed nor revocable).
//
// The v2 signature above covers ONLY the username. That leaves two holes:
//
//  1. The cookie's lifetime lives entirely in the browser's `MaxAge`. MaxAge is
//     a hint to the browser, not a server-side claim — a copied cookie value is
//     accepted forever, because nothing in the signed bytes says when it was
//     issued or when it stops being valid.
//  2. Logout only deletes the browser's copy. Anyone who captured the value
//     keeps a working session across logout, password change, or account
//     removal, for as long as the signing key stays accepted.
//
// v3 closes both by moving the claims INSIDE the signature:
//
//	v3 value = <base64url(JSON{u,iat,exp,sid})>.v3.<base64url(Ed25519-Sign(payload))>
//
// The signature covers the encoded payload bytes, so issued-at, expiry, and the
// session ID are all tamper-evident. Expiry is then enforced by the VERIFIER
// (hub and spoke alike) rather than trusted to the browser, and `sid` gives
// logout something concrete to revoke — see hub_session_revocation.go.
//
// Unlike v2, the username is no longer in the clear at the head of the value;
// it is a field of the signed payload. That is why v3 needs its own marker: the
// two shapes are not parseable by the same code, and the marker is what lets a
// single verifier route the value to the right parser without guessing.
const hubCookieV3Marker = ".v3."

// hubCookieClaims are the signed contents of a v3 session cookie. Field names
// are SHORT and FROZEN: the Node proxy (v2/proxy/server.js) parses these exact
// JSON keys, and a rename on one side alone silently 401s every hosted login at
// deploy time. Do not "tidy" them.

	// browser's MaxAge, so a copied cookie dies on schedule.

	// SID is the unguessable per-session ID that revocation is keyed on. It is
	// what makes logout mean something for a value that has already left the
	// browser.
	SID string `json:"sid"`
	// G names the master GENERATION whose derived seed signed this cookie
	// (hub_generations.go). It is a SELECTION HINT, not a claim of authority:
	// it lets the verifier check one generation instead of trying each, and it
	// lets telemetry answer "is anything still using the old key?" without
	// reading the code. It names a key; it is not a key, so carrying it in the
	// clear costs nothing.
	//
	// `omitempty` is load-bearing in BOTH directions:
	//
	//   - Omitted on the wire when zero, so a hub that has never rotated mints
	//     byte-identical cookies to the ones it mints today. Deploying this is
	//     therefore not observable at the cookie level.
	//   - Absent on every cookie already sitting in a browser, which is all of
	//     them. Verification treats a zero G as UNMARKED and falls back to
	//     trying each acceptable generation, so no live session is logged out.
	//
	// The Node proxy (v2/proxy/server.js verifyHubUserCookieV3) parses u/iat/
	// exp/sid and ignores unrecognized fields, so adding this one is additive
	// and needs no spoke roll — which is the whole reason the marker lives in
	// the payload rather than as a "g<N>." prefix on the cookie value. A prefix
