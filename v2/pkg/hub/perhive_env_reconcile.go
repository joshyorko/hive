// Per-hive security env reconcile — makes the fleet's key posture code-owned.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The C2/N1/N2/N3 work moved every spoke off the shared
// master onto derived, per-hive sub-keys, and the provisioning template
// (saas_provision.go) renders all six vars. But that template is `kubectl
// apply`ed ONLY inside provisionHive — at provision/assign time. Hives
// provisioned BEFORE those vars entered the template never received them, and
// nothing re-asserts them afterwards.
//
// What actually put the vars on the live fleet was an out-of-band `kubectl
// patch`, not any code path: a live spoke's
// kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration still lists only the
// pre-cutover env shape (HIVE_GITHUB_TOKEN, DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN, HIVE_ID,
// HIVE_LEVEL, HIVE_HUB_URL, HIVE_HUB_SECRET) while the live .spec has the new
// vars appended after HIVE_HUB_SECRET — and in a different order from the
// template, which emits them instead of the master. So the fleet's security
// posture is held in place by a manual edit that no controller maintains: any
// re-provision, restore, or manifest reapply silently reverts a spoke to
// master-derived fallbacks (spokeDomainKey / TerminalSigningKey /
// SpokeSSOPublicKey all fall through to HIVE_HUB_SECRET when their dedicated
// var is absent, which is precisely the fleet-uniform sharing N1/N3 removed).
//
// Four spokes were missed by that manual patch entirely and run on master-only
// fallbacks today, including a real external user's hive. This sweep repairs
// them and, more importantly, means the next drift is repaired automatically
// instead of by hand.
//
// SCOPE / SAFETY. This lane is ADDITIVE ONLY. It never removes HIVE_HUB_SECRET.
// Stripping the master from spoke Deployments is a separate, fleet-visible
// cutover with its own hard preconditions (every spoke must be on an image that
// reads the dedicated vars, and the readiness counts below must be zero across
// a full sweep); doing it here would couple a silent repair to a breaking
// change.
//
// This mirrors the NET_ADMIN reconcile (netadmin_reconcile.go) deliberately:
// same cluster access path, same unreachable-cluster suppression, same
// idempotent-check-then-patch shape. Divergence between two sweeps that both
// mutate the hive Deployment would be its own maintenance hazard.

// WHY THIS EXISTS. The original guard was `h.Status != "running"`, copied from

// The two code paths that do write "running" (the provision watcher in
// saas_provision.go, and the stale-"error" clear on heartbeat in server.go)
// only fire from the transient "provisioning"/"error" states, so a hive in
// steady state never reaches or holds it. The sweep therefore `continue`d on
// every hive of every cycle and had never patched a spoke; the fleet's key
// posture was still held in place by the out-of-band `kubectl patch` this lane
// exists to replace, and the four known-drifted spokes never converged.
//
// WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE EXPRESSED. Not "is running" but "is deployed" — does
// this hive plausibly have a hive Deployment to reconcile? The sibling sweeps
// over the same listSaaSHives() (triggerAutoUpgrades, sweepOrphanedUpgrades,
// sweepStuckAssignments) apply NO status filter at all and gate instead on the
// resources they actually need. This predicate follows that convention, only
// naming the one status that is genuinely premature.
//
//   - "" (28 live) — the common steady state; a provisioned hive that has
//     simply never had a status written. Must be swept: two of the four
//     drifted spokes sit here.
//   - "available" (30 live) — an unclaimed pre-provisioned placeholder. It is
//     genuinely deployed, its Deployment is live, and it must carry correct
//     per-hive keys BEFORE it is claimed — a placeholder that is assigned to a
//     user while running on master-derived fallbacks hands that user a spoke
//     with fleet-shared keys, exactly what N1/N3 removed.
//   - "assigned" (8 live) — claimed and deployed. Obviously swept.
//   - "running" — kept so the pre-existing intent still selects, not because
//     anything reaches it.
//   - "error" — SWEPT. The status is frequently stale (only a heartbeat clears
//     it), the Deployment usually still exists, and an unconverged key is a
//     plausible CAUSE of the error rather than a reason to leave it drifted.
//
// Only "provisioning" is excluded: the namespace and Deployment are still
// being applied, so a read would fail anyway and the provisioning template
// renders all six vars correctly at creation. This is a cheap-cycle

// WHY THIS IS NOT SOURCED FROM HEARTBEAT RECENCY. The sibling signal in this
// file's neighbour, AuthRolloutReadiness, is built from noteHeartbeatAuthPath
// observations and drops any hive not seen within authRolloutStaleAfter (24h).
// Its own doc comment records the consequence: it cannot distinguish "hive
// absent" from "hive never existed", so a hive that is merely PAUSED,
// mid-upgrade, or on a temporarily unreachable cluster silently leaves the
// denominator — and the fleet then reads ready while that spoke is still
// unconverged. For a signal that gates deleting a compat lane, that failure
// mode is the whole risk.
//
// These counts therefore come from the hub's OWN Deployment reads in
// reconcilePerHiveEnv, not from anything the spoke sends. A paused spoke still
// has a Deployment, so it is still read, still counted, and still blocks
// convergence until it is actually fixed. A spoke cannot fall out of the
// denominator by going quiet; it falls out only when the hub can no longer read
// it (in which case it was never counted as converged either) or when the hive
// is deprovisioned and explicitly forgotten.
