// Automatic retirement of expired master generations, and the alert that fires
// when one is about to strand spokes (follow-on PR #7 of
// v2/docs/design/master-key-rotation.md).
//
// WHAT WAS ALREADY TRUE BEFORE THIS FILE, AND WHY THAT MATTERS. The security
// guarantee — step 5 of the rotation procedure, "after verify_until the
// previous generation stops being accepted, automatically, whether or not
// anyone is watching" — was ALREADY kept by acceptableGenerations(now) in
// hub_generations.go. That function excludes any non-current generation whose
// VerifyUntil has passed, and treats a ZERO VerifyUntil as ALREADY EXPIRED
// rather than as "never expires", so a hand-edited or malformed generations
// file fails closed. Every verifier on the platform goes through it. Nothing in
// this file weakens, duplicates, or re-implements that filter, and nothing in
// this file is load-bearing for the guarantee: if this whole lane never ran,
// an expired generation would still stop verifying on the wall clock.
//
// SO WHAT IS THIS FOR. Two things the read-path filter cannot do by itself:
//
//  1. PERSIST the drop. acceptableGenerations is a pure read-path predicate; it
//     leaves the dead entry sitting in the set on disk forever. A generation
//     that is no longer accepted but is still recorded is a plaintext master
//     secret retained on the hub PVC past the point where it protects anything
//     — the F1/F2 residue in a different form. Retirement rewrites
//     hub-generations.json without it, so the secret stops existing rather than
//     merely stopping being honoured.
//
//  2. ALERT. Retirement on the wall clock is unconditional, which means it can
//     and will strand spokes that have not converged. That is the CORRECT
//     behaviour — the alternative, waiting for convergence, is what lets one
//     unreachable spoke pin the old master open forever — but it is not a
//     silent one. The operator gets a warning as the window closes with spokes
//     still on the old key, and a louder one after it closes.
//
// THE TWO CONDITIONS ARE DELIBERATELY NOT THE SAME CONDITION. The design states
// both, and collapsing them would be the bug:
//
//   - RETIREMENT (here) is a WALL-CLOCK SECURITY GUARANTEE. It fires when
//     VerifyUntil has passed, FULL STOP — never gated on spokes_on_previous,
//     never gated on spokes_unattributed, never gated on whether anything was
//     observed at all. Gating it on convergence would mean a single spoke on an
//     unreachable cluster keeps a superseded master secret live indefinitely,
//     which is precisely the "unversioned and permanent compat lane" failure
//     mode the explicit-finiteness property exists to prevent.
//
//   - SafeToRetirePrevious (perhive_env_reconcile.go, unchanged by this file)
//     is an OPERATOR-FACING READINESS SIGNAL meaning "retiring right now costs
//     nothing". It fails closed on zero observations and on any unattributed
//     spoke, deliberately. It answers "is this free?", not "will this happen?".
//
// Retirement does not read SafeToRetirePrevious and must never learn to. The
// counts feed the ALERT only — they change how loudly retirement is announced,
// never whether it occurs.
