// Master-secret GENERATIONS — the mechanism that makes rotation possible.
//
// THE PROBLEM. Every piece of signing material on the platform is a pure
// function of ONE value, the hub master secret, with no marker recording which
// master produced it (hub_keys.go: heartbeat, session, session-Ed25519, SSO,
// impersonate, terminal, invite). The "-v1" suffixes on the info labels version
// the DOMAIN, not the key. So changing the master changes all seven derived
// values at once, and no verifier can accept both the outgoing and the incoming
// form. A rotation is therefore a fleet-wide flag day: every browser session
// invalidated, every heartbeat 401'd, every SSO handoff unverifiable, across ~66
// hosted spokes, simultaneously. Which is why the master has never been rotated
// and, as the code stands, cannot be.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE FIX. The hub holds an ORDERED SET of generations rather than
// a single secret. Exactly one is CURRENT — the only one that MINTS — and zero
// or more are PREVIOUS, accepted for VERIFY only and each carrying an explicit
// expiry. Rotation promotes a new current and demotes the outgoing one, so
// artifacts minted before the rotation keep verifying while artifacts minted
// after it use the new material. Convergence of spoke-held material then happens
// through the existing rate-limited reconcile lane (perhive_env_reconcile.go),
// not through a re-provision.
//
// WHY THIS IS NOT THE "VERIFY-BOTH" LANE THAT TOOK FIVE AUDITS TO REMOVE. The
// F1/F2 lanes were verify-both lanes too, and they were a real vulnerability for
// years. What made them so was not that they accepted two credentials — it was
// that they were UNVERSIONED and PERMANENT. Nothing in the code named which
// alternative was the legacy one, and nothing said when it stopped being
// accepted, so the only mechanism that could ever end them was an audit finding.
// Both properties are fixed here deliberately:
//
//   - VERSIONED. A previous generation is a numbered entry in a list, not an
//     unnamed `if` branch. "Which key accepted this request" is a value the code
//     returns (see verifyWithGenerations) and the telemetry can count, so the
//     question "is anything still using the old key?" has an answer that does not
//     require reading the code.
//   - FINITE. Every previous generation carries VerifyUntil. An expired
//     generation is not accepted, full stop — the window closes on a wall clock
//     whether or not anyone remembers to close it. This is the property the F1/F2
//     lanes lacked entirely, and it is why this one cannot rot into permanence
//     the way those did.
//
// DERIVATION IS UNCHANGED. Each generation's secret feeds deriveDomainKey and
// derivePerHiveKey exactly as the single master does today. No domain's key
// FORMAT changes, which is what lets a rotation happen without the Node proxy or
// any spoke needing to understand generations at all: a spoke handed a
// HIVE_SESSION_KEY derived from generation 3 just has a different string in its
// env than it had before, and every existing code path treats it identically.

// keyGeneration is one master secret plus the metadata that says what may be
// done with it and until when.

	// turn every heartbeat into unbounded HMAC work and hand an attacker a cheap
	// asymmetric cost. At 2, the worst case is two HMAC computations where there
	// was one — less than the rest of a heartbeat already costs.
	//
	// 2 is also the smallest value that permits rotation at all (you need the
	// incoming and the outgoing one simultaneously), so it is deliberately the
	// minimum that works rather than a round number. Raising it would allow

// rotation mechanism itself require the flag day it exists to avoid. Those
