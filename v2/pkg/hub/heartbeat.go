// lastHeartbeatSuccessUnix holds the unix-seconds timestamp of the most
// recent heartbeat the hub accepted (HTTP < 300 from either the regular
// StartHeartbeat loop or SendUpgradingHeartbeat). It is process-global
// because a hive runs at most one heartbeat loop, and it needs to be read
// from the dashboard's HTTP handler goroutine (the liveness endpoint) while
// being written from the heartbeat goroutine — hence atomic rather than a
// mutex-guarded field, so the health handler never blocks on the sender.
//
// Zero means "no successful heartbeat yet" (process just started, or the
// hive doesn't run a heartbeat loop at all). Callers distinguish those two
// cases via HeartbeatEnabled, not via this timestamp alone.
var lastHeartbeatSuccessUnix atomic.Int64

// heartbeatLoopStarted records whether StartHeartbeat actually launched a
// loop for this process (i.e. hubURL was non-empty). A hive with no hub
// configured never sends heartbeats, so its liveness check must not gate on
// heartbeat freshness at all — otherwise every hub-less hive would fail
// liveness forever. Set once at startup; read from the HTTP handler.
var heartbeatLoopStarted atomic.Bool

// heartbeatLoopActive is the process-wide "a heartbeat loop is RUNNING right
// now" guard — deliberately separate from heartbeatLoopStarted, which records
// "a loop was ever launched" and feeds /api/livez via HeartbeatEnabled (a
// semantics that must not change: liveness keeps gating on heartbeat freshness
// even while a duplicate start is being refused).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (#2453): a production spoke was observed running TWO
// concurrent heartbeat loops in one process — two independent 2-minute
// cadences from one pod, alternating a fresh and a stale auth snapshot on the
// wire, flipping the hub registry every beat. The code has exactly one
// StartHeartbeat call site, so the second loop's origin is unknown. This CAS
// makes a second concurrent loop impossible no matter what path tries to
// start one: the first caller wins, every later caller is refused and returns
// cleanly. The refusal logs the refused caller's FULL STACK at ERROR, so the
// next time the trigger fires in production the log names it — the guard is
// both the fix and the instrument.
//
// Cleared (via defer) when a loop exits on context cancellation, so a
// deliberate stop-then-restart stays possible; only CONCURRENT duplication is
// refused.
var heartbeatLoopActive atomic.Bool

// lastHeartbeatAttemptUnix holds the unix-seconds timestamp of the most
// recent heartbeat the loop *tried* to send, regardless of whether the hub
// accepted it, rejected it (4xx/5xx), or was unreachable entirely.
//
// This is the signal that separates the two failure modes a stale
// lastHeartbeatSuccessUnix otherwise conflates:
//
//   - Attempts advancing but successes not: the goroutine is alive and doing
//     its job; the *hub* is unreachable or rejecting. Restarting the pod
//     cannot fix a network partition or a hub outage, so liveness must not
//     fail — this is routine on firewalled clusters that can only reach the
//     hub intermittently.
//   - Attempts themselves not advancing: the loop is genuinely wedged (dead
//     goroutine, deadlock, permanently stuck HTTP call). A restart is the
//     only remedy, so this is what liveness should catch.
//
// Same atomic rationale as lastHeartbeatSuccessUnix: written by the heartbeat
// goroutine, read by the dashboard's HTTP handler goroutine.
var lastHeartbeatAttemptUnix atomic.Int64

// lastGoodPayload caches the most recent payload a collect() actually
// produced. It exists so a beat whose collect() TIMED OUT can still be sent —
// carrying slightly-stale stats — instead of being dropped entirely.
//
// WHY (offline regression from the #3743 collect-timeout fix): when /data
// (NFS RWX PVC) wedges, the agent-manager mutex is held across the stuck write
// and collect() -> AllStatuses() blocks every cycle. #3743 bounded collect()
// so the loop keeps ticking (liveness stays green), but on timeout it returned
// nil and sendHeartbeat SKIPPED THE ENTIRE BEAT — POSTing nothing to the hub.
// On a persistently-wedged spoke every beat's collect() times out, so every
// beat was skipped, the hub received no heartbeats, and after the stale
// threshold the UI marked an alive, 1/1-Ready hive OFFLINE. Caching the last
// good payload lets the spoke keep beating (marked StatsStale) through the
// stall so the hub keeps it online.
//
// Guarded by its own mutex because the collect goroutine writes it (on
// success) while the sender reads it (on timeout); the two can overlap when a
// late-returning wedged collect finally completes. A whole-payload clone is
// stored so a later in-place mutation of the returned payload (name filtering,
// timestamp stamping in sendHeartbeat) never races a reader of the cache.

	// A GitHub App identity is an ATOMIC SET — app_id, app_slug, api_url and
	// base_url must all name the same forge. The hub pushes app_id and app_slug
	// (HeartbeatGitHubAppConfig) and api_url (HeartbeatProjectConfig), but until
	// now it received back only app_id and the key fingerprint. Two of the
	// pushed fields were therefore STRUCTURALLY UNCONFIRMABLE: the hub could
	// push a slug or an installation id and had no way, ever, to learn whether
	// it landed.
	//
	// That is not a theoretical gap. A cluster-config change pushed a GHE
	// app_id to a set of hives WITHOUT a matching api_url. The spokes ended up
	// with a GHE App ID pointed at api.github.com and every token request
	// failed:
	//
	//	POST https://api.github.com/app/installations/<id>/access_tokens
	//	404 Integration not found
	//
	// The hives that also received api_url=https://github.ibm.com/api/v3 were
	// fine — the failure split exactly on that one field. With only app_id
	// reported back, a half-applied identity is invisible to the hub: it looks
	// like a successful delivery. Reporting the whole set is what makes the
	// inconsistency detectable, and is a prerequisite for ever confirming a
	// delivery of it.
	//
	// Both are NON-SECRET. Empty/zero means "too old to report, or not
	// configured" — read as UNKNOWN, never as a mismatch. Never infer a
	// half-applied identity from silence; see IdentitySetIssues.
	GitHubAppSlug string `json:"github_app_slug,omitempty"`
	// GitHubInstallationID is the installation the spoke is using. It is
	// forge-scoped: an ID issued by one forge names nothing on another, which is
	// why a forge switch deliberately never carries it across.
	GitHubInstallationID int64 `json:"github_installation_id,omitempty"`
	// GitHubBaseURL is the web base URL the spoke runs against (github.base_url).

	// here so the hub can see the COMPLETE identity set and detect a base_url
	// that disagrees with api_url.
	GitHubBaseURL string `json:"github_base_url,omitempty"`
