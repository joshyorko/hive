// NET_ADMIN reconcile — closes the pre-#1222 securityContext drift.
//
// The provisioning template (saas_provision.go) requests NET_ADMIN on the hive
// container's securityContext, but that manifest is `kubectl apply`ed ONLY
// inside provisionHive — at provision/assign time. Hives provisioned BEFORE
// #1222 (when NET_ADMIN was added to the template) still carry an empty
// `securityContext: {}` on their LIVE Deployment and were never re-applied.
//
// That drift is harmless today but becomes fatal the moment the F5 fatal-egress
// image (#2664) rolls to such a hive: without NET_ADMIN the forced iptables
// egress redirect can't be established, the F5 fatal check exits 1, and the pod
// crash-loops. This reconcile repairs the drift fleet-wide WITHOUT a full
// re-provision (which would re-deliver secrets/tokens and is far heavier).
//
// Scope: ALL hub-managed hosted hives with a resolvable cluster — not just
// auto-upgrade hives. A drifted hive with auto-upgrade OFF still crash-loops if
// it is ever manually rolled onto the F5 image, so the correction must reach it
// too (issue #2674).
//
// OpenShift caveat (#2674): on OpenShift/OVN clusters, NET_ADMIN in the podspec
// is necessary but NOT sufficient — `iptables -t nat -N` is denied at a layer
// below the SCC/pod-capability grant (node/CNI/OVN or seccomp). This reconcile
// only ensures the podspec REQUESTS NET_ADMIN, which is correct and necessary
// everywhere. It deliberately does NOT try to solve the node-level OpenShift
// question: those hives additionally rely on the SO_MARK path (#2678/#2696) and
// may still need HIVE_PROXY_ADVISORY_OK=true — out of scope here.

// netAdminSweepEligible reports whether a hive with this lifecycle status
// should be examined by the NET_ADMIN drift sweep. Extracted as a named
// predicate — the same shape as securityContextHasNetAdmin — so the selection
// rule is a single testable decision that the sweep and its test share, rather
// than an inline comparison a test could only re-implement (and therefore keep
// passing after the sweep's own check broke).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The original guard was `h.Status != "running"`. It selected
// NOTHING: across the live 66-hive registry the status distribution is 30
// "available", 28 "", 8 "assigned" — zero "running". Only two sites write
// "running": the provision watcher in saas_provision.go, which sets it on the
// transition OUT of "provisioning", and the stale-"error" clear on heartbeat in
// server.go, which is gated on Status == "error" and so only rescues a hive out
// of error. Neither puts or holds a steady-state hive at "running", and nothing
// re-asserts it, so a hive in steady state never carries it. This sweep
// therefore `continue`d on every hive of every cycle and has never patched a
// Deployment in production — the pre-#1222 drift it exists to close was only
// ever repaired by the out-of-band `kubectl patch` recorded in issue #2674.
//
// WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE EXPRESSED. Not "is running" but "is deployed" — does this
// hive plausibly have a hive Deployment to reconcile? The sibling sweeps over
// the same listSaaSHives() (triggerAutoUpgrades, sweepOrphanedUpgrades,
// sweepStuckAssignments) apply NO status filter at all and gate instead on the
// resources they actually need. This predicate follows that convention, naming
// only the one status that is genuinely premature.
//
//   - "" (28 live) — the common steady state: provisioned and deployed, with a
//     status that was simply never written. Must be swept.
//   - "available" (30 live) — an unclaimed pre-provisioned placeholder. Its
//     Deployment is live, and it must carry NET_ADMIN BEFORE it is claimed: a
//     placeholder handed to a user while drifted crash-loops the moment the F5
//     fatal-egress image rolls onto it, which is the exact failure this sweep
//     exists to prevent.
//   - "assigned" (8 live) — claimed and deployed. Obviously swept.
//   - "running" — kept so the pre-existing intent still selects, not because
//     anything reaches it.
//   - "error" — SWEPT. The status is frequently stale (only a heartbeat clears
//     it), the Deployment usually still exists, and missing NET_ADMIN is a
//     plausible CAUSE of the error (an F5 fatal-egress crash-loop presents
//     exactly this way) rather than a reason to leave it drifted.
//
// Only "provisioning" is excluded: the namespace and Deployment are still being
// applied, and the provisioning template has requested NET_ADMIN since #1222, so
// a hive created now is born correct. This is a cheap-cycle optimisation, NOT a
// safety gate. The sweep is safe on an unreadable hive for a stronger reason
// than its per-hive-env sibling: a failed `kubectl get` logs at Debug and
// `continue`s, and this sweep records NO observations of any kind — it has no
// seen-map and publishes no convergence surface, so there is no state in which
// an unread hive could ever be counted as healthy.
