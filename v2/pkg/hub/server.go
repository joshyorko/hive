//
// An image ref is the one heartbeat field where a colon is structural: it
// separates repo from tag ("hive:v2-latest"), introduces a digest algorithm

// shared sanitizer stripped it, turning "ghcr.io/kubestellar/hive:v2-latest"

// which the pinned-image drift rule then reported as a CRITICAL pin on eleven
// perfectly healthy rolling hives.
//
// The allowlist is exactly the character set legal in an OCI reference:
// alphanumerics plus the "-_./" of a repository path, ":" for tag/port/digest
// algorithm, and "@" for a digest. Everything else — quotes, angle brackets,
