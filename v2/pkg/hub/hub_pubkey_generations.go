// SSO / SESSION Ed25519 PUBLIC KEY plurality — follow-on PR #6 of the
// master-key rotation design (v2/docs/design/master-key-rotation.md).
//
// WHY THIS ONE IS SEQUENCED LAST, AND WHY IT IS A DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM #1-#5.
// Every earlier follow-on made a HUB-side verifier accept two generations. The
// hub holds the whole generation set, so "accept both" was a local change: read
// one more entry out of a struct the hub already has.
//
// This one is not that. The SSO handoff token and the hub session cookie are
// MINTED ON THE HUB and VERIFIED ON THE SPOKE — by Go in
// pkg/dashboard/api.go (SSO) and, independently, by Node in v2/proxy/server.js
// (session cookie). The verifying party does not hold the generation set, does
// not hold any master, and by design holds no private material at all. It holds
// ONE hex Ed25519 public key that the hub put in its Deployment env.
//
// So the failure this PR exists to prevent is not "the hub rejects an old
// artifact". It is the mirror image: the hub, the instant it rotates, starts
// minting under generation N, and ~65 spokes are still holding generation N-1's
// PUBLIC key. Those spokes cannot verify anything the hub now mints. Every
// hosted SSO handoff 401s and every hosted terminal session fails its cookie
// check — not for the 30 minutes an impersonation cookie lives, but for the
// ~6 hours the rate-limited reconcile lane takes to walk the fleet at 3 patches
// per 15-minute cycle. That is the flag day, relocated from the hub to the
// fleet.
//
// THE FIX IS THEREFORE PLURALITY ON THE SPOKE, NOT SELECTION ON THE HUB. A
// spoke must hold BOTH live generations' public keys and try each. Which puts
// this squarely in the design doc's "CANNOT carry a marker" bucket —
//
//	| SSO/session PUBLIC keys | A hex Ed25519 public key has a fixed 32-byte form. |
//
// — so the mechanism is BOUNDED TRIAL VERIFICATION against the live
// generations, current-then-previous, bounded by maxLiveGenerations == 2. Worst
// case is two Ed25519 verifications on a path that already does one.
//
// ORDERING — THE PROPERTY THE WHOLE PR TURNS ON.
//
// The VERIFIER must be able to accept two public keys BEFORE the hub ever hands
// out a second one. A spoke whose proxy understands only one key, handed a
// second, is not merely un-improved — depending on the env contract it can be
// actively broken (see EnvSSOPublicKeyPrevious below for the delimited-list
// analysis that ruled that encoding out). So this PR ships ONLY the verifier
// plurality and the provisioning of the second var. It does not, and cannot,
// cause a rotation: rotation is triggered by the admin endpoint from #4, and
// until an operator calls it there is exactly ONE generation.
//
// WITH ONE GENERATION THIS IS A NO-OP, BY CONSTRUCTION. previousPublicKeys
// returns an empty slice whenever acceptableGenerations yields only the current
// generation, which is the state of every hub in the fleet today and the state
// of every hub that has never been rotated. An empty previous list means:
//   - desiredPerHiveEnv emits NO second var, so perHiveEnvDrift sees no drift,
//     so NO spoke is patched and NO pod rolls;
//   - the Go and Node verifiers evaluate a zero-length candidate list after the
//     primary key and behave byte-identically to today.
//
// The second var appears on a spoke for the first time only after a rotation,
// and disappears again — via the same drift-and-patch lane — once the previous
// generation expires out of acceptableGenerations. It is self-clearing, which
// is what stops it becoming the unversioned permanent compat lane that F1/F2
// were.

	// the tempting option — it touches no provisioning surface and no reconcile
	// list. It is wrong, and the reason is measurable rather than aesthetic.
	//
	// The value in HIVE_SSO_PUBLIC_KEY is read by TWO independently written
	// verifiers, and during the ~6h reconcile walk some spokes are running the
	// OLD image. Feed "<hex>,<hex>" to each of them:
	//
	//   Node  Buffer.from(v,'hex')      -> 32 bytes. Silently truncates at the
	//                                      first non-hex byte, yielding key #1.
	//                                      Keeps working, by accident.
	//   Go    hex.DecodeString(v)       -> error "invalid byte: U+002C ','".
	//                                      SpokeSSOPublicKey / VerifySSOToken
	//                                      fail closed. SSO DEAD on that spoke.
	//
	// The two languages disagree about what a delimited list means, and the
	// disagreement is exactly "does hosted SSO still work on an un-rolled
	// spoke". A list would therefore break SSO on every spoke the reconcile
	// lane has patched but that has not yet rolled the new image — which is the
	// entire fleet for the first cycle, and a shrinking slice of it for six
	// hours. Backward compatibility here is mandatory, so the encoding that has
	// a defined meaning to old readers wins: an ADDITIONAL var, which old code
	// does not read at all and is consequently unable to misread.
	//
	// A separate var is also the only encoding that lets a spoke's key set
	// SHRINK cleanly. Retirement removes a var, which both readers already
	// handle (absent == empty == no candidate); shrinking a list would require
	// old readers to re-parse a value they are truncating anyway.

// TIMING / NON-DISCLOSURE. The loop does NOT return early. It evaluates every
// candidate key and records the first index that verified, so the number of
// Ed25519 operations performed is a function of how many keys the spoke holds
// and never of WHICH key matched. Returning on first success would leak, through
// response latency, whether this spoke has been reconciled onto the new
