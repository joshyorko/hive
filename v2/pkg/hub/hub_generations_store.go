// Persistence and the operator-facing rotate mechanism for master-secret
// generations (follow-on PR #4 of v2/docs/design/master-key-rotation.md).
//
// The foundation (hub_generations.go) can already REPRESENT a rotation:
// generationSet.rotate is pure, maxLiveGenerations bounds the set, and every
// previous generation carries VerifyUntil. What it cannot do is CREATE one, or
// remember one. Both gaps are closed here, and they are closed together
// deliberately: an endpoint that rotates without persisting would produce a
// rotation that survives until the next hub roll — which happens several times
// a day — and a hub that came back holding only generation 1 would reject every
// artifact minted since the rotation while quietly re-minting on the old key.
// That is strictly worse than never having rotated.
//
// WHY A SEPARATE FILE FROM hub-secret.key. /data/saas/hub-secret.key stays
// exactly as it is — 64 hex bytes, raw, never rewritten by this code. It is
// generation 1's secret and nothing else, so a hub that rolls BACK to
// pre-rotation code finds precisely the file it expects and keeps working on
// generation 1. Rewriting it in place would make rollback a data-loss event.
// The generations live alongside it in hub-generations.json, and when that file
// is absent — the state of every hub in the fleet today — the loader synthesizes
// legacyGenerationSet from hub-secret.key. So there is no migration step and no
// flag day: "never rotated" and "rotated back down to one generation" are the
// same on-disk state.

// hubGenerationsPath is where the generation set is persisted.
//
// A SIBLING of /data/saas/hub-secret.key on the hub PVC, which is the volume
// that survives a pod roll — and the hub rolls several times a day, so anything
// held only in memory is effectively not held at all. Verified live: the hub's
// HIVE_HUB_SECRET env is UNSET and hub-secret.key exists on the PVC at 64
// bytes, so the file is the live source of the master and this file sits in the
// same durable place.
//
// A var, not a const, so tests can redirect it — the same convention as
// alertAcksPath, journeyStatePath, and revokedSessionsPath.
var hubGenerationsPath = "/data/saas/hub-generations.json"

// hubGenerationsFileMode is 0600, NOT the 0644 the other /data/saas JSON files
// use. Those hold acks, banners, and journey state; this one holds MASTER
// SECRETS in plaintext, so it matches hub-secret.key's own 0600 rather than its
// neighbours' mode.
const hubGenerationsFileMode = 0o600

// hubGenerationsQuarantineSuffix preserves an unparseable file for inspection
// instead of overwriting it.
//
// The recovery differs sharply from the alert-acks precedent, and the
// difference is the point. A corrupt acks file is discarded and the system
// starts fresh, because losing an ack merely un-silences an alert — the safe
// direction. A corrupt GENERATIONS file must NOT be discarded and replaced with
// a fresh rotation: that would mint new material the fleet has never seen while
// forgetting the generation the fleet is actually on. So the loader falls back
// to the legacy single-generation set (which is always correct, because
// hub-secret.key is authoritative for generation 1) and leaves the bad bytes on
// disk. Fail closed, then let an operator look.

// lost ack — an unparseable generations file means the hub falls back to
// generation 1 on its next restart.

// file" and "this hub has never rotated" resolve identically.
//
//   - Missing file: normal. Every hub in the fleet is in this state today.
//   - Unparseable: quarantined, legacy set returned. NOT replaced with a fresh
//     rotation — see hubGenerationsQuarantineSuffix.
//   - Parseable but with no generation matching Current: newGenerationSet
//     returns nil (a set with no minting key is unusable, not degraded), so the
//     legacy set is returned.
//   - Any generation with an empty secret is dropped by newGenerationSet, which
//     is what stops a hand-edited file from making verification compare against
//     empty keys.
//
// Note what is deliberately NOT validated here: an expired VerifyUntil. An
// expired previous generation is loaded into the set and then excluded by
// acceptableGenerations at every VERIFY. Filtering at load time instead would
// make expiry depend on when the hub last restarted — a generation would stay
// live across a long-running process and vanish on a roll. The wall clock must
// be the only thing that closes the window.
//

// WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN QUEUE OR SILENTLY ALLOW. maxLiveGenerations is 2, and
// deliberately so (see its comment). rotate() carries forward ONLY the outgoing
// current, so rotating twice in quick succession DROPS the generation from two
// rotations ago — and that dropped generation is exactly the one most of the
// fleet is still on, because the reconcile lane walks spokes at 3 patches per
// 15-minute cycle. A second rotation an hour into the first would leave ~54 of
// 66 spokes holding material the hub no longer accepts: they would 401 on every
// heartbeat until the sweep reached them, hours later. That is the fleet-wide
// flag day this entire design exists to prevent, reintroduced through the front
// door.
//
// The cooldown is sized to the CONVERGENCE time, not to the verify window. 66
// spokes at 3 per 15-minute cycle is ~5.5 hours, so 8 hours covers a full sweep
// with margin for cycles lost to unreachable clusters. It is deliberately much
// shorter than defaultVerifyWindow (7 days): waiting for the previous
// generation to EXPIRE before allowing another rotation would make emergency
// re-rotation impossible for a week, and the actual hazard is unconverged
// spokes, not the old key still being accepted.

// itself is compromised (a leaked rotate response, a bad deploy), rotating
