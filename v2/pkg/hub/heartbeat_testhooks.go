// This file exposes write access to the process-global heartbeat atomics so
// tests in *other* packages (notably pkg/dashboard, which owns the /api/livez
// handler) can simulate heartbeat states without standing up a real hub and
// heartbeat loop. The production paths that set these live in heartbeat.go.
//
// These are deliberately exported rather than kept in an _test.go file: Go
// only compiles _test.go files into their own package's test binary, so a
// helper defined in hub's tests would be invisible to dashboard's tests.
// Nothing in the production code calls them.

// SetHeartbeatStateForTest overrides the heartbeat loop state used by liveness
// and health reporting. A zero attempt or success time clears that timestamp,
// making it read as "never happened".

// ResetHeartbeatStateForTest returns the heartbeat atomics to their
// process-start values (no loop, no attempts, no successes) and clears the
// cached last-good collect payload. Tests that mutate this global state should
// defer it so they don't leak into other tests — in particular so one test's
// cached payload cannot make another test's timed-out collect look like it
// still had fresh stats to fall back on.
