// Rollout readiness telemetry for the N1/N2 compatibility lanes (issue #3234).
//
// N1 (per-hive heartbeat bearer) and N2 (Ed25519 session cookie) both shipped
// as verify-both / mint-new: the hub accepts the new credential OR the legacy
// one, and issues only the new one. That was required — a flag-day cutover
// would have 401'd every spoke in the fleet at once, the failure mode #2773
// documented for the v2-hub/v4-spoke split.
//
// But each legacy lane IS the vulnerability it replaced. The fleet-wide
// heartbeat bearer does not bind identity, so an un-rolled spoke can still
// claim any hive_id; the symmetric session key that verifies a cookie can also
// mint one, including an admin cookie. They must be removed.
//
// The blocker was observability: "has every spoke re-provisioned?" had no
// answer short of inspecting each Deployment by hand, so the lanes would have
// lingered indefinitely — which is how a temporary compatibility path becomes
// permanent. This records which format each spoke actually presents, so the
// decision is made on evidence.
//
// STATUS: the N1/F2 heartbeat lane is DELETED — verifyHeartbeatBearer now
// accepts only the per-hive bearer, so PerHiveBearer is necessarily true for
// every hive that authenticates at all. This file is retained because (a) the
// N2 session-cookie lane is still mid-rollout and (b) GET
// /api/saas/admin/auth-rollout remains the operator's post-cutover view: a hive
// that vanishes from the heartbeat totals is one that is now failing auth.

// authRolloutEntry is the last-seen credential format for one hive.

	// PerHiveEnv is the Deployment-SOURCED convergence view for the five

	// has ONE readiness page — but the two halves of this response are sourced
	// differently on purpose, and the difference matters for the master-secret
	// cutover this gates.
	//
	// Everything above comes from heartbeat observations and is subject to
	// authRolloutStaleAfter: a hive that has not beaten in 24h simply leaves
	// the totals, and as the constant's own comment records, this signal cannot
	// distinguish "hive absent" from "hive never existed". A paused spoke
	// therefore drops silently out of the denominator and the fleet reads ready
	// while that spoke is unconverged.
	//
	// PerHiveEnv is immune to that: its counts come from the hub reading each
	// spoke's Deployment itself. A paused hive still has a Deployment, so it is
	// still read, still counted, and still blocks convergence. Gate the
	// master-secret removal on THESE numbers, not on the heartbeat totals.

// authRolloutStaleAfter bounds how old an observation may be and still count.
// A hive that has not heartbeated within this window is treated as absent, not
// as legacy — otherwise a long-deleted hive would block the removal forever.
//
// 24h is chosen against the two ways this can be wrong, which fail in opposite
// directions:
//
//   - TOO SHORT and a hive that is merely paused, mid-upgrade, or on a
//     temporarily unreachable cluster drops out of the denominator. The fleet
//     then reads ready while that spoke is still on the legacy bearer, and
//     removing the lane 401s it the moment it comes back.
//   - TOO LONG and every hive ever deleted keeps counting as a legacy laggard,
//     so readiness never arrives and the compat lane becomes permanent — the
//     precise failure this whole signal exists to prevent.
//
// Spokes beat on the order of a minute, so 24h is ~1000x the cadence: far past
// any transient blip, but short enough that a decommissioned hive clears within
// a day. If the fleet ever adopts long-lived paused hives that stop beating
// entirely, revisit this — a paused hive should ideally be excluded explicitly
// rather than by timeout.
