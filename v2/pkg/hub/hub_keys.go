// Domain-separated key derivation for the hub master secret (CWE-321/798, C2).
//
// Historically ONE symmetric key, HIVE_HUB_SECRET, signed EVERYTHING: the
// heartbeat bearer, the session cookie, the SSO handoff token, and the
// impersonation cookie — and that same master was injected in plaintext into
// every spoke Deployment. Any spoke operator could read it from the pod env and
// forge admin session cookies, mint SSO-as-any-owner tokens, or emit
// impersonation grants. The signing material for browser/admin trust lived on
// machines whose operators are NOT trusted with that authority.
//
// The fix keeps a single master secret but derives a DISTINCT sub-key per trust
// domain. A holder of one domain's sub-key learns nothing about the master or
// the other domains' keys (HMAC is a PRF), so a sub-key can only ever sign/verify
// within its own domain. Crucially this lets the hub hand a spoke ONLY the
// sub-keys it actually needs (heartbeat + session + sso verification) while the
// impersonation key — and the master itself — never leave the hub.
//
// Derivation is HMAC-SHA256(master, info) rendered as lowercase hex. This is a
// standard HKDF-Expand-style single-block expansion: deterministic, no extra
// dependency (x/crypto/hkdf is not a direct module dependency), and more than
// sufficient for domain separation since each info string is a fixed, unique
// label. The output is hex so every derived key is a safe ASCII value for an env
// var, a Bearer token, and an HMAC key on both the Go and Node sides.

// two HMAC computations where there was one — strictly less than the rest of a

// Lane 2 is the F2 fix. The per-hive bearer is HMAC(master, info || 0x00 ||

// this code, which is what lets the hub's legacy lane be deleted afterwards.

// WHY THIS EXISTS AS ONE FUNCTION. saas_provision.go's template data map and

// env vars byte-identically — desiredPerHiveEnv's own doc comment says so, and
// the consequence of divergence is not subtle: the sweep would see "drift" on
// every freshly provisioned hive, patch it, and roll its pod every cycle
// forever. Making them both resolve their master through THIS function means a
// rotation cannot move one side without the other.
//
// TODAY THIS IS EXACTLY legacyGenerationSet(provisionMasterSecret()). There is
// no persisted generations file yet and no endpoint that can create a second
// generation (that is follow-on PR #4), so currentSecret() is always the same
// string provisionMasterSecret() returns and every derived value is
// byte-identical to what this code produced before generations existed. This
// change is a READ-PATH change in effect: it re-expresses where the master
// comes from without changing which master it is.
//
// Returns nil for an empty master, and currentSecret() on a nil set returns ""
