// Tests for follow-on PR #7: automatic retirement past verify_until, and the
// alert that fires when a generation is pinned open.
//
// The properties under test, in order of how badly they hurt if broken:
//
//  1. RETIREMENT IS UNCONDITIONAL ON CONVERGENCE. A generation past
//     VerifyUntil is retired EVEN WITH SPOKES STILL ON IT. Gating retirement on
//     spokes_on_previous would let one unconverged spoke pin a superseded
//     master live forever — the "unversioned and permanent compat lane" failure
//     that took five audits to remove. This is the point of the PR.
//  2. VerifyUntil.IsZero() STILL MEANS ALREADY EXPIRED, on every path this PR
//     adds. A hand-edited file must fail closed, not pin a key open.
//  3. THE WALL-CLOCK GUARANTEE AND THE READINESS SIGNAL STAY SEPARATE.
//     SafeToRetirePrevious still fails closed on zero observations and on
//     non-zero spokes_unattributed; retirement ignores both.
//  4. RETIREMENT SURVIVES A RESTART, and a failed persist is a clean no-op.
//  5. THE FOUR MERGED READERS reject — not error — against a just-retired
//     generation.
