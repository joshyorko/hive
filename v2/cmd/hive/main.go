//
// A hub-delivered key lands at spokeAppKeyPath (/data, on the PVC) and the
// heartbeat callback repoints cfg.GitHub.KeyFile at it — but only in memory, for
// the life of that process. A hive whose config carries NO key_file (which is
// the state of the three live GHE hives this repairs) used to fall straight
// through to the read-only /secrets provisioning mount. That mount holds the
// stale, wrong key, and the spoke cannot write to it. So on every restart the
// hive would silently go back to signing with the key that cannot work, and the
// hub — seeing the wrong fingerprint reported again — would redeliver forever.
// The key would be delivered and never used: a fault that reads as fixed.
//
// So when nothing is explicitly configured, a key already present on the PVC is
// preferred over the provisioning mount. An EXPLICIT key_file or env override
// still wins outright: those are deliberate, and this must not silently redirect
// an operator who named a path.
//
// PER-APP-ID SELECTION (the both-keys fix)
//
// appID is the App this process is configured to authenticate AS
// (cfg.GitHub.AppID). When the hub has delivered a per-app-id key for exactly
// that App — /data/gh-app-key-<appID>.pem — it is preferred over the generic
// single-file paths, because it is provably the RIGHT key for the app_id we
// claim. This is what lets a github.com hive on a GitHub-Enterprise cluster sign
// with the github.com key even though its cluster default (and its single
// /data/gh-app-key.pem) is the GHE key. It sits just below an explicit
// key_file/env override — an operator who named a path still wins — and above
// the generic fallbacks. appID <= 0 disables it entirely, so nothing changes for
// a hive that reports no app_id.

		// correct by construction and the generic pin is stale, so ignore it.
		//
		// Without this, the ~33 spokes already carrying
