#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-suid-contract.sh — static contract check that the hive image never
# ships a WORLD-EXECUTABLE setuid-root helper (security finding C6,
# CWE-250/269).
#
# Background. The image needs a SUID `su-exec` so the non-root `dev` process can
# switch to per-agent UIDs at runtime (pkg/agent/manager.go,
# pkg/dashboard/workspace_cleanup.go, deploy/ttyd-tmux.sh — all run AFTER the
# entrypoint's `exec gosu dev`). The original build did
# `curl .../master/su-exec.c | gcc | chmod u+s`, producing a mode-4755
# setuid-root binary that ANY agent UID could exec as `su-exec root sh` → root
# in the pod holding the org GitHub App key, every agent token, and iptables
# control. That collapsed per-UID isolation and the F5 forced-egress guarantee.
#
# The fix (Option B — the SUID helper is genuinely required, so it is TIGHTENED,
# not removed): pin su-exec by commit SHA + verify SHA256, then own it
# root:hive-launch mode 4750 so only root and the dedicated launcher group (sole
# member: dev) can exec it. This check locks that invariant in so a future edit
# can't silently regress back to a world-exec SUID binary or an unpinned source.
#
# Invariant (asserted against v2/Dockerfile):
#   - NO `chmod u+s` / `chmod 4755` / world-exec SUID mode on su-exec.
#   - su-exec source is pinned by commit SHA (not the moving `master` ref).
#   - the SHA256 of the pinned source is verified before compiling.
#   - the installed helper is chmod 4750 and owned by root:hive-launch.
#
# NET_ADMIN invariant (#3760 — asserted against Dockerfile + entrypoint):
#   - NO `setcap` file capability on the hive binary (a file cap EPERMs on exec
#     wherever the runtime bounding set lacks the cap — the #3760 crash-loop).
#   - the entrypoint instead raises NET_ADMIN as an AMBIENT capability, gated on
#     the CAP_NET_ADMIN bounding-set bit, via `setpriv --ambient-caps +net_admin`,
#     with a `gosu dev` fallback when the cap is unavailable.
#

# self-hosted k3s/rootless spoke), producing the #3760 exec-EPERM crash-loop. A

# raises NET_ADMIN as an AMBIENT capability, gated on the bounding set having it.
