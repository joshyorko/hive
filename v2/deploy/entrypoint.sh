# ── Config backup/restore across container recreation ─────────────────
# When Watchtower recreates the container (pull new image, stop old, start
# new), the Go binary's config.Save() may write an empty/default config to
# the bind-mounted hive.yaml during shutdown or early startup, wiping the
# host file. /data/ is a Docker named volume that persists across container
# recreations, so we keep a rolling backup there.
#
# In Kubernetes, the ConfigMap is the source of truth — admins update it to
# change settings like acmm_level, is_public, etc. The PVC copy is only
# used for disaster recovery if the ConfigMap volume is missing or empty.
#
# In Docker/LXC there is no ConfigMap and no overlay: the PVC copy IS the
# boot-time source of truth, restored over the config path (or read directly
# when that path is read-only) on every boot. See the Docker branch below.
#
# ── Naming: hive.yaml.runtime, formerly hive.yaml.bak ─────────────────
# The old .bak name implied "the restorable backup", which is only half
# true and cost real debugging time: on K8s it is a post-merge SNAPSHOT
# written after the merge, while on Docker/LXC it is a live boot INPUT.
# ".runtime" is honest for both — it is the runtime config as this hive
# last had it.
#
# MIGRATION (one release): ~51 live hives have only the old-named file on
# their PVC. We WRITE the new name and READ the old one when the new is
# absent. We deliberately do NOT rename on the PVC: on Docker/LXC that
# file is the only copy of the live config, and mutating it at boot risks
# losing owner customisations with no warning. The old name is picked up
# read-only until the first save writes the new one, after which both
# exist and the new one wins.

      # (refs #2678, #2674). Restoring the owner-UID RETURNs immediately fixed OKE.

  # is absent — refs #2674/#2678). We used to grant this as a FILE capability on
  # /usr/local/bin/hive, but the kernel refuses execve of a file-capped binary
  # whenever the runtime's BOUNDING set lacks that cap (default docker/podman/
  # containerd, i.e. every self-hosted k3s/rootless spoke) → bare EPERM at exec,
  # the crash-loop in #3760. The binary now ships with NO file capability; we
  # instead raise NET_ADMIN as an AMBIENT capability HERE, gated on the bounding
  # set actually having it — so managed spokes (SCC/PSA grant NET_ADMIN) get the
  # cap and self-hosted spokes exec cleanly and degrade the SO_MARK path.
  #

# ── Proxy CA trust for the MAIN Go hive process (race-free) ──────────────
#
# CHICKEN-AND-EGG (fixed in the Go binary; this block is now belt-and-suspenders):
# /data/proxy-ca.pem is GENERATED BY the Go proxy at runtime
# (proxy.NewGitHubProxy → loadOrGenerateCA). On a fresh-PVC boot it does NOT
# exist when the entrypoint reaches the `[ -f /data/proxy-ca.pem ]` gate below,
# so SSL_CERT_FILE was never exported and the Go process launched trusting only
# the (still-installing) system store → a multi-minute post-roll window where
# every token mint failed "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority".
# The Go binary now establishes its OWN proxy-CA trust: the token-mint HTTP
# client (pkg/github/proxytrust.go) carries a RootCAs pool = system roots +
# /data/proxy-ca.pem, LAZILY reloaded from disk, so the first mint after the
# proxy writes the CA trusts it immediately, with no dependency on this export.
# The block below is kept because it still helps Node/sub-processes and any Go
# restart, and it is now correct whether or not the CA exists yet at this point.
#
# The Go hive process makes GitHub App token calls
# (POST /app/installations/{id}/access_tokens). With F5 forced egress enabled
# (the iptables REDIRECT of all outbound :443 to the MITM proxy, set up above),
# those calls hit the proxy, which presents a cert forged by /data/proxy-ca.pem.
# Go's crypto/x509 must trust that CA or every token mint fails with
# "x509: certificate signed by unknown authority" → "all N repos failed" → the
# agent loop is dead (verified live on the console hive).
#
# We CANNOT rely on the system-trust install below (the gosu/update-ca-certificates
# block after the launch) for the Go process, for two reasons:
#   1. RACE: the Go process starts here, BEFORE that install runs, and Go caches
#      the system cert pool at first TLS handshake. A boot-time gosu failure
#      ("WARN: proxy CA install via gosu failed", seen live) then leaves the
#      already-running Go process permanently unable to verify the proxy cert —
#      the later CA-watch re-install loop cannot fix a pool Go already cached.
#   2. Go honors SSL_CERT_FILE at handshake time (NOT cached like the system
#      bundle), so pointing it at a file we control is robust and race-free.
#
# We point SSL_CERT_FILE at a COMBINED bundle = public roots + proxy CA, NOT the
# proxy CA alone. Rationale: SSL_CERT_FILE REPLACES the trust set, so proxy-CA-only
# would make Go trust ONLY the proxy CA and break any HTTPS that does NOT traverse
# the MITM proxy — which happens in advisory mode (HIVE_PROXY_ADVISORY_OK=true, no
# iptables redirect: the Go process then reaches api.github.com / a GHE host
# directly with a REAL public cert). The combined bundle trusts BOTH the real
# public roots AND the proxy CA, so it is correct whether or not egress is forced.
