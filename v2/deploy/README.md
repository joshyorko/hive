# v2 deployment scripts

This directory contains Kubernetes/LXC manifests plus runtime helper scripts used by the Hive container. The dashboard terminal pane uses two small helpers that are easy to miss:

## Dashboard TTY helpers

### `ttyd-tmux.sh`

`ttyd` serves the browser terminal websocket, but agent tmux sessions may be owned by per-agent UIDs. Because tmux only lets the socket owner attach, `ttyd-tmux.sh <session>` finds the matching `/tmp/tmux-*/<session>` socket, derives its numeric UID/GID, and uses `su-exec` to attach as that owner. While attached it enables tmux mouse mode (so the scroll wheel drives copy-mode scrollback instead of just reflowing the viewport — issue #3694) and raises the session `history-limit` (default `50000`, override with `HIVE_TTYD_HISTORY_LIMIT`) for panes created later in the session. Both options are restored to their previous values on detach. Note that tmux reads `history-limit` at pane creation, so the attach-time raise cannot deepen an already-created pane — the authoritative deep-scrollback depth is set when the agent manager creates the session (`newSessionCommands` in `v2/pkg/agent/manager.go`, default `50000`, override with `HIVE_TMUX_HISTORY_LIMIT`).

Use it indirectly through the dashboard terminal link. If a terminal pane says no tmux socket was found, check that the agent session name exists and that the socket is present under `/tmp/tmux-*` in the container.

### `hive-panes.sh`

`hive-panes [lines]` prints the last N raw-output lines from every other agent's pluk JSONL log in `/var/run/pluk/logs`. It skips the caller named by `HIVE_PROXY_AGENT`, strips ANSI/control sequences, and never attaches to another tmux session. Agents can run it for read-only peer awareness when diagnosing fleet activity. See [Agent peer-awareness logging](../docs/agent-logging.md) for what pluk is, the JSONL format, and when logs are (or aren't) available.
