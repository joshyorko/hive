// ── #4247: shared convergence admission for internal agent kicks ──────────────
//
// Contributor offerability and assignment already withhold a dependency-blocked
// or unknown candidate (#3857/#3904), but scheduled and cached manual internal-
// agent kicks render the raw enumerated issue set. This file provides the ONE
// read-only admitted-issue projection the eval-cycle dispatch boundary consumes,
// built from the SAME observer (observeCandidateDependencies) and the SAME pure
// evaluator (convergence.Evaluate) the contributor paths use — one normalized
// observation/evaluator contract, never a reimplementation in scheduler code.
//
// Rollout (maintainer requirement, precedes #4263): callers gate on the
// convergence feature toggle. With mode "off" (default) this projection is
// never invoked — the kick path is entirely inert and unchanged. With mode
// "shadow" the caller computes the projection and LOGS what would have been
// withheld, but always dispatches the raw population — observed, never
// enforced. Enforcement is a later, explicit increment.
//
// Deliberate scope, per the #4247 contract:
//   - CONVERGENCE admission only. The open-PR claim ledger is not consulted
//     here: internal kicks already have their own claim policy
//     (applyDuplicatePRGuard honours hive-authored claims only, #3792), and
//     re-applying the contributor-side any-claim rule would silently change it.
//   - Nothing is cached across passes; every call builds a fresh sweep from
//     current authoritative bead state, so the judgment is level-triggered and
//     reconstructs identically after a restart.
//   - The raw actionable population remains authoritative for governor queue
//     counts/mode/cadence, dashboard status, PR/review dispatch, escalation,
//     and merge eligibility — this projection covers the ISSUE list only.

// ConvergenceKickFinding is one issue the shared convergence admission would
// withhold from internal agent kicks, with the exact Decision that judged it.

//
// Read-only and side-effect free: it assigns nothing, mutates nothing, and the
// input slice is never modified (admitted is a new slice). A hub with no
// contribute hub or no bead ledger wired admits everything — identical to the
// contributor path's behaviour in the same state. Non-GitHub-backed items skip
// the GitHub-only bead observer and are admitted on its behalf, exactly as
