// ── Dependency observation for contributor-neutral admission (#3845) ──────────
//
// This is the FIRST observer feeding pkg/convergence: it reads the bead ledger —
// Hive's existing durable, dependency-bearing work record (ADR 0004) — and
// reports, per live GitHub candidate, whether that candidate's declared
// dependencies are satisfied. Nothing here decides admission; it only observes.
// pkg/convergence.Evaluate makes the judgment, and
// evaluateContributorNeutralAdmission applies it to BOTH live projections
// (ReadyQueue offerability and selectTask assignment) so they cannot drift.
//
// Deliberate non-goals, per the design contract:
//
//   - It creates NOTHING. Admission consumes authoritative state; it never mints
//     a shadow bead merely to have something to query. A candidate with no bead
//     is observed as "no record", not conjured into one.
//   - It is not a second scheduler. A blocked candidate is simply absent from
//     the admitted set; ordering, routing, and dispatch are untouched.
//   - It caches nothing across evaluations. Every ReadyQueue / selectTask sweep
//     re-reads the ledger, which is what makes admission LEVEL-TRIGGERED: when a
//     dependency becomes satisfied the dependent becomes offerable on the next
//     sweep with no restart, and when it becomes unsatisfied again the dependent
//     leaves the ready set just as promptly. Events are hints; current state is
//     the truth.
//
// Freshness horizon. The bead ledger is durable local state, so a restart
// reconstructs exactly the same admission decisions from the same files with no
// replay. Beads written by AGENT processes (the `bd` CLI persists straight to
// disk) reach the hub's in-memory stores through the bounded authoritative
// refresh the governor already performs — the per-eval-cycle Store.Reload() in
// cmd/hive/main.go — so a dependency closed by an agent gates admission within
// one eval cycle. This observer deliberately does NOT add its own disk read to
// the assignment path: that would race the governor's refresh and put I/O in
// front of every candidate for no freshness that the next cycle would not give.

// beadDependencyIndex is a per-sweep snapshot of the bead ledger, built once and
// reused for every candidate in that sweep.
//
// Why an index rather than a FindByExternalRef per candidate: a live hive scans
// on the order of 150 actionable issues per sweep, and FindByExternalRef is a
// linear scan of a store that may hold thousands of beads, across several agent
// stores — so the naive form is a multi-million-operation quadratic inside the
// task-assignment path. One pass builds both lookups instead.
//
// What that pass deliberately does NOT do is copy the ledger. The sweep sits on
// the assignment path and holds each store's read lock for the whole of its
// pass, so every byte it materialises is latency in front of task assignment and
// a writer (Close, AddDependency) kept waiting. Only two questions are ever
// asked of the ledger — "is there a record declaring THIS candidate's work?"
// (byRef) and "is the bead this edge names satisfied?" (byID) — so only the
// beads that can answer the first get a record built, the second is answered by
// one bool per bead, and retirement is resolved on demand for the few edges that
// resolve nowhere. At ~10 stores near the 5000-bead cap that is the difference
// between copying the whole ledger per selection and reading it (#3845 review).
//
// It is a SNAPSHOT, not a cache: it lives for exactly one sweep and is thrown
// away, so it can never serve a stale satisfaction judgment to a later sweep.
// It holds COPIED VALUES rather than the live *beads.Bead pointers the store
// owns, for two reasons: a writer closing a bead mid-sweep must not make one
// candidate see the before-state and the next the after-state, and reading a
// live bead outside the store lock while another goroutine mutates it is a data
// race. The copy is taken INSIDE the lock via Store.ReadEach — copying outside
// it would narrow that race, not remove it.

// observeCandidateDependencies is the bead-backed observer: it turns one live

//
// The three outcomes it can report, and why each is what it is:
//
//   - NO BEAD STORES AT ALL (stores == 0): reported as "not found", i.e. no
//     declared dependencies, so admission is unchanged from before this feature.
//     This is deliberately NOT reported as degraded. A hive with no bead ledger
//     has not FAILED to observe anything — there is no intent to observe — and
//     treating it as degraded would refuse every candidate in every hub booted
//     without beads, stalling the whole contributor queue on a feature that
//     nobody opted into.
//
//   - NO BEAD FOR THIS CANDIDATE: "not found". The explicit lookup-miss policy
//     (convergence.Evaluate rule 2): a miss means the candidate declared no
//     dependencies. It never means a dependency was satisfied.
//
//     This holds even when the snapshot is PARTIAL — a configured store failed
//     to open. The no-false-satisfaction instinct says to withhold such a miss,
//     since the record might be in the store we could not read. That was the
//     original rule here and it is wrong at this scale: on a real hive most
//     actionable issues never get a bead, so withholding every miss turns one
//     unreadable beads.json into a fleet-wide stall — an empty queue, endless
//     no_matching_work, and a symptom that reads as a hub bug. This gate is
//     additive over having no gate at all, so a truncated view degrades to
//     "gate what we can actually see". A partial ledger is LOGGED every sweep
//     (newAdmissionSweep) so the reduced coverage is visible instead of silent,
//     and candidates whose record WAS found remain fully gated.
//
//   - A BEAD EXISTS: each DependsOn edge is resolved against the ledger.
//     Terminal statuses (done/closed) are satisfied; any live status is
//     unsatisfied; an edge naming a bead absent from every store is UNKNOWN
//     rather than either, because a dangling reference is a record we cannot
//     read, not a dependency we can wave through — the same fail-closed
//     instinct Store.Ready() already applies to a missing parent epic.
//
// The observed generation is the bead's last-update timestamp: the revision of
// desired state this judgment was made against. It is reported for logs and
