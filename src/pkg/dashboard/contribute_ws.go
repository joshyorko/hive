//
// Why this is load-bearing (#2644): currentTask.Repo is normally set by selectTask
// to chosen.repoFull (== repo.Full). But the task_progress RESUME path re-populates
// currentTask from the CLIENT-supplied msg.Repo after a reconnect (the relay keeps
// its task locally and re-asserts it via task_progress). If the relay reports the
// repo in ANY other spelling than repo.Full — a bare name where the hub uses
// "owner/repo", or a differently-cased/prefixed cross-org name — then every
// server-side "%s#%d" key built from currentTask.Repo silently MISSES:
//   - the activeIssues double-assign guard no longer excludes the in-flight issue,
//     so a concurrent selectTask hands the SAME issue to a second contributor; and
//   - the disconnect/abandon reconnect-window cooldown (recordTaskFailure) is booked
//     under the wrong key, so it does not protect that issue either.

// This is exactly the #2356/#2492 duplicate-assignment race re-opened through a key
// mismatch, and it is intermittent + repo-specific: it only fires for a repo whose
// relay-reported name differs from the hub's repo.Full, and only across a reconnect
// that resumes via task_progress — which is why #2644 was seen "only in this repo".

	//       no "blocking"), and those PRs land in FrontendRepo.OpenPrs, which this
	//       selector does not read at all.
	//     * github.PullRequest has no review-decision field.
	//   So this change implements ONLY the ordering half of #2390, keyed on the one
	//   own-work signal that actually exists today (issue authorship). When the
	//   contributor has no own-authored candidate, we fall back to today's exact
	//   ordering — behaviour is unchanged in that (common) case.
