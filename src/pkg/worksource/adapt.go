// ToGitHubIssues converts a worksource Issue slice into the github.Issue shape
// that the scheduler and governor consume. GitHub-native fields not present in
// the worksource type (AgeMinutes, IsTracker, ComplexityTier, ModelRec, Lane)
// are left at their zero values and will be populated downstream by classify.
//
// SourceType and ExternalID are carried across (kubestellar/hive#4245). They are
// the item's ONLY identity when Number is 0, which is every Linear and Jira
// item: without them the projection is lossy and every downstream site collapses
// distinct work onto "repo#0". GitHub-backed items keep Number, so their keys
// stay byte-identical "repo#number".
