// applyConvergenceKickAdmission is the #4247 eval-cycle seam, formalised by
// #4263 into the SINGLE mode applicator every enrolled guard consumes (no
// per-feature booleans). It runs the shared convergence dependency admission
// (the SAME observer + pure evaluator the contributor queue and selectTask
// consume, via dashboard.ConvergenceKickProjectionDetailed) over the issue
// population that is about to be cached for manual kicks and rendered into
// scheduled kicks, and returns the ActionableResult the scheduler must use.
//
// Rollout contract (maintainer requirement, kubestellar/hive#4263):
//
//   - "off" (DEFAULT): return the input untouched before computing anything —
//     no sweep, no decision, no telemetry. The kick path is byte-for-byte the
//     pre-#4247 path; existing v4 hives see ZERO behaviour change.
//   - "shadow": compute the projection ONCE on a fresh sweep, LOG what would
//     have been withheld, record one soak telemetry row, and return the RAW
//     input — observed, never enforced.
//   - "enforce": the SAME projection from the SAME sweep gates ONLY this
//     enrolled internal-dispatch path: the returned result carries the
//     admitted issue projection while PRs, holds, clusters, and per-repo
//     counts stay untouched. The raw actionable population remains
//     authoritative for governor policy, cadence, classification, dashboard
//     status, PR/review dispatch, escalation, and every path not explicitly
//     enrolled — the caller passes the raw result everywhere else.
//
// The (mode, generation) pair is captured ONCE at the start of the pass
// (dashboard.CaptureConvergenceMode); every candidate in this pass is judged
// and attributed under that captured pair even if an owner flips the setting
// concurrently — the next pass picks up the change, so a switch is live
// without a rebuild, restart, queue surgery, or stored-state migration.
//
// Mode TRANSITIONS are logged and notified exactly once per crossing (the
// #4305 probe-notification discipline): never at boot, never once per cycle.
//
// The function never mutates its input. It is nil-safe on every dependency so
// a hive booted without a dashboard (or a test harness) cannot panic here.
