//
// WHY A SECOND VAR RATHER THAN A DELIMITED LIST IN HIVE_SESSION_PUBLIC_KEY.
// Because the same value is read by an independently written Go verifier
// (hub.SpokeSSOPublicKey / VerifySSOToken), and the two languages do NOT agree
// on what "<hex>,<hex>" means:
//
//   Node  Buffer.from(v,'hex')  -> 32 bytes; silently truncates at the comma.
